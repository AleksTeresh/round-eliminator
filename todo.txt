Minor/performance:
- The order of labels changes strangely
- for semimatching on bipartite graphs, autolb spends 20% of the time checking for triviality
- avoid recomputing the diagram from scratch in case of relax
- find a nice way to handle diagrams in the case of harden()

Todo:
- gui: manual relabeling
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub
- gui: spinner autolb many labels appears later
- panics on the server while doing gui things
- gui: escape html entities

Bugs:
- if a simplification is performed, new arrows may appear in the diagram (start from matching, simplify P->U, the arrow M->U appears, before M was disconnected), but in autolb these arrows are not computed.
