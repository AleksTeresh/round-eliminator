- The order of labels changes strangely
- for semimatching on bipartite graphs, autolb spends 20% of the time checking for triviality
- avoid recomputing the diagram from scratch in case of relax
- find a nice way to handle diagrams in the case of harden()
- gui: manual relabeling
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub
- gui: spinner autolb many labels appears later
