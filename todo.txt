Todo:
- hardening by keeping lines instead of labels
- It would help the automatic lb/ub if the bidirectional edges force a simplification before doing anything else.
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub when the server is used 
- after simplifications, remove lines on the left side that are not needed (there exists another line that allows strictly more)
- in autoub, do not generate strings to check for a fixpoint
- check for solvability given a weak coloring
- use the tree decidability results for binary lcls

Todo soon:
autoub autolb: add rcs parameter to cli, add new options to cli
do simplifications even if it is possible to perform speedup

Bugs:
in server mode, sourceless and sinkless orientation Delta=3, automatic lower bound, gives errors (only on firefox, it seems that it does not like when many connections are opened at the same time). It is caused by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052398
on safari autolb autoub threads are not interrupted
handle spaces in multicharacter labels
escaping in performed simplification
constraint.rs from_vec remove the assert and return an error
if a new problem is created from text, and it does not fit the bits, it may create something wrong (should add a check that delta*labels is small enough)
