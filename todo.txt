- The order of labels changes strangely
- it would be nice to hide the compute_* methods in problem.rs, and modify e.g. is_trivial() such that it never fails.
- The original right contraints may give a diagram with cycles, and the second part of get_diagram_edges_from_rightconstraints, is not correct in that case.
- The program panics with autoub/autolb if the number of allowed labels is less than the initial ones.
- auto lb/ub, if the initial problem is zero round solvable, it does not write anything
