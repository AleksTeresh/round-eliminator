- The order of labels changes strangely
- it would be nice to hide the compute_* methods in problem.rs, and modify e.g. is_trivial() such that it never fails.
- The original right contraints may give a diagram with cycles, and the second part of get_diagram_edges_from_rightconstraints, is not correct in that case. The same may happen for a problem that is the result of harden().
- for semimatching on bipartite graphs, autolb spends 20% of the time checking for triviality
