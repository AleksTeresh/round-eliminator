Minor/performance:
- The order of labels changes strangely

Todo:
- hardening by keeping lines instead of labels
- relax by making the diagram a path (guaranteed fixpoint), in general allow "add arrow" relaxation. Even better: automatic lower bound thing where one specifies the "maximum amount of non comparable labels on the diagram"
- It would help the automatic lb/ub if the bidirectional edges force a simplification before doing anything else.
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub when the server is used 
- after simplifications, remove lines on the left side that are not needed (there exists another line that allows strictly more)
- in autoub, do not generate strings to check for a fixpoint
- check if using hashmap instead of vec didn't make things too slow

Todo soon:
autoub autolb: add rcs parameter to cli, add new options to cli
do simplifications even if it is possible to perform speedup
add all nodes to the diagram

Bugs:
in server mode, sourceless and sinkless orientation Delta=3, automatic lower bound, gives errors (only on firefox, it seems that it does not like when many connections are opened at the same time)
on safari autolb autoub threads are not interrupted
handle spaces in multicharacter labels
escaping in performed simplification
