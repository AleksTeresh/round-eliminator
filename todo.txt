Minor/performance:
- The order of labels changes strangely
- for semimatching on bipartite graphs, autolb spends 20% of the time checking for triviality
- when harden() or simplify(), new arrows may appear. AutoLB and AutoUb are currently ignoring new arrows, and compute them only when giving the result (to show the right diagram).

Todo:
- hardening by keeping lines instead of labels
- relax by making the diagram a path (guaranteed fixpoint), in general allow "add arrow" relaxation
- It would help the automatic lb/ub if the bidirectional edges force a simplification before doing anything else.

Todo soon:
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub when the server is used 
- gui: write on top of each rectangle what was the step that brought us to this rectangle from the previous one

Bugs:
