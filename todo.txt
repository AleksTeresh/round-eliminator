Minor/performance:
- The order of labels changes strangely

Todo:
- hardening by keeping lines instead of labels
- relax by making the diagram a path (guaranteed fixpoint), in general allow "add arrow" relaxation
- It would help the automatic lb/ub if the bidirectional edges force a simplification before doing anything else.

Todo soon:
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub when the server is used 
- when a problem is shown, write the list of labels that are equal (and could be simplified)

Bugs:
in server mode, sourceless and sinkless orientation Delta=3, automatic lower bound, gives errors (only on firefox, it seems that it does not like when many connections are opened at the same time)
