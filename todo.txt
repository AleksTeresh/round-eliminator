- The original right contraints may give a diagram with cycles, and the second part of get_diagram_edges_from_rightconstraints, is not correct in that case. The same may happen for a problem that is the result of harden(). This is currently fixed by showing an arrow  A->C even if there is A->B and B->C
- The order of labels changes strangely
- for semimatching on bipartite graphs, autolb spends 20% of the time checking for triviality
- avoid recomputing the diagram from scratch in case of relax
