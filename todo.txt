Todo:
- hardening by keeping lines instead of labels
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub when the server is used 
- in autoub, do not generate strings to check for a fixpoint
- check for solvability given a weak coloring
- use the tree decidability results for binary lcls

Todo soon:
do simplifications even if it is possible to perform speedup
if removing lines did not change anything, it is not needed to recompute the diagram

Bugs:
in server mode, sourceless and sinkless orientation Delta=3, automatic lower bound, gives errors (only on firefox, it seems that it does not like when many connections are opened at the same time). It is caused by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052398
on safari autolb autoub threads are not interrupted
