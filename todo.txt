Minor/performance:
- The order of labels changes strangely
- for semimatching on bipartite graphs, autolb spends 20% of the time checking for triviality
- when harden() or simplify(), new arrows may appear. AutoLB and AutoUb are currently ignoring new arrows, and compute them only when giving the result (to show the right diagram).

Todo:
- hardening by keeping lines instead of labels

Todo soon:
- gui: allow interrupting autolb autoub
- if the server is closed, handle the error on the client

Bugs:
- broken pipe if speedup takes too much
- gui: spinner autolb many labels appears later (can not reproduce)
